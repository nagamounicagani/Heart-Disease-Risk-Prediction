Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of global mortality. We propose a
predictive framework for assessing individual risk of heart disease by leveraging
environmental, behavioural, and medical history factors. Our approach builds a
logistic regression model in Python and further employs support vector
machines and anomaly‑detection techniques for model tuning and comparative
evaluation. We rigorously assess model performance using accuracy, precision,
recall, and ROC‑AUC metrics on a publicly available dataset. Our experiments
demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection improves sensitivity to
at‑risk individuals, while SVM‑based tuning enhances discriminative
performance relative to the baseline logistic regression. The results underscore
the value of combining classical and advanced machine learning methods for
early detection and proactive management of cardiovascular disease risk.
